<p class="par first">When Christendom was groping amid the
superstitions of the Dark Ages, and the Norsemen were ravaging the
western part of Europe, and the princes of Islam were cutting each
other&rsquo;s throats in the name of Allah and his Prophet,
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;l-Ma&rsquo;arri was waging his bloodless war
against the follies and evils of his age. He attacked the superstitions
and false traditions of law and religion, proclaiming the supremacy of
the mind; he hurled his trenchant invectives at the tyranny, the
bigotry, and the quackery of his times, asserting the supremacy of the
soul; he held the standard of reason high above that of authority,
fighting to the end the battle of the human intellect. An intransigeant
with the exquisite mind of a sage and scholar, his weapons were never
idle. But he was, above all, a poet; for when he stood before the
eternal mystery of Life and Death, he sheathed his sword and murmured a
prayer.</p>
<p class="par">Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;l-Ma&rsquo;arri,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e334src" href="#xd21e334" name="xd21e334src">1</a> the
Lucretius of Islam, the Voltaire of the East, was born in the spring of
the year 973 A.D., in the obscure village of Ma&rsquo;arrah,<a class=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e349" href="#xd21e349" name=

south of Halab (Aleppo). And instead of Ahmad ibn Abdallah ibn Sulaiman
ut-Tanukhi (of the tribe of Tanukh), he was called Abu&rsquo;l-Ala (the
Father of the Sublime), by which patronymic of distinction he is
popularly known throughout the Arabic speaking world.</p>
<p class="par">When a boy, Abu&rsquo;l-Ala was instructed by his
father; and subsequently he was sent to Halab, where he pursued his
studies under the tutelage of the grammarian Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn
us-Sad. His literary proclivity was evinced in his boyhood, and he
wrote verse, we are told, before he was ten. Of these juvenile pieces,
however, nothing was preserved.</p>
<p class="par">He was about five years old when he fell a victim to
small-pox and almost lost his sight from it. But a weakness in his eyes
continued to trouble him and he became, in middle age, I presume,
totally blind.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e355src" href="#xd21e355"
name="xd21e355src">3</a> Some of his biographers would have us believe
he was born blind; others state that he completely lost his sight when
he was attacked by the virulent disease; and a few intimate that he
could see slightly at least with the right eye. As to whether or not he
was blind when he was sent to Halab to pursue his studies, his
biographers do not agree. My theory, based on the careful perusal of
his poems and on a statement advanced by one of his
biographers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e363src" href="#xd21e363" name=
"xd21e363src">4</a> is that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e366"
href="#xd21e366" name="xd21e366">13</a>]</span>he lost his sight
gradually, and total blindness must have come upon him either in his
youth or his middle age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e368src" href=
"#xd21e368" name="xd21e368src">5</a> Were we to believe that he was
born blind or that he suffered the complete loss of his sight in his
boyhood, we should be at a loss to know, not how he wrote his books,
for that was done by dictation; not how he taught his pupils, for that
was done by lectures; but how he himself was taught in the absence in
those days of a regular system of instruction for the blind.</p>
<p class="par">In 1010 A.D. he visited Baghdad, the centre of learning
and intelligence and the capital of the Abbaside Khalifs, where he
passed about two years and became acquainted with most of the literary
men of the age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e382src" href="#xd21e382"
name="xd21e382src">6</a> He attended the lectures and the readings of
the leading doctors and grammarians, meeting with a civil reception at
the hand of most of them.</p>
<p class="par">He also journeyed to Tripoli,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e405src" href="#xd21e405" name="xd21e405src">7</a> which boasted,
in those days, of many public libraries; and, stopping at Ladhekiyah,
he lodged in a monastery where he met and befriended a very learned
monk. They discussed theology and metaphysics, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e408" title="Source: disgressing">digressing</span> now and then
into the profane. Indeed, the skepticism which permeates
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s writings must have been nursed in that convent
by both the monk and the poet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e411"
href="#xd21e411" name="xd21e411">14</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">These are virtually the only data extant showing the
various sources of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s learning; but to one endowed
with a keen perception, a powerful intellect, a prodigious memory,
together with strong innate literary predilections, they seem
sufficient. He was especially noted for the extraordinary memory he
possessed; and around this our Arab biographers and historians weave a
thick net of anecdotes, or rather fables. I have no doubt that one with
such a prodigious memory could retain in a few minutes what the average
person could not; but when we are told that Abu&rsquo;l-Ala once heard
one of his pupils speaking with a friend in a foreign tongue, and
repeated there and then the long conversation, word for word, without
having the slightest idea of its meaning, we are disposed to be
skeptical. Many such anecdotes are recorded and quoted by his Arab
biographers without as much as intimating a single doubt.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e414src" href="#xd21e414" name="xd21e414src">8</a>
The fact that he was blind partly explains the abnormal development of
his memory.</p>
<p class="par">His career as poet and scholar dates from the time he
returned from Baghdad. This, so far as is known, was the last journey
he made; and his home became henceforth his earthly prison. He calls
himself &ldquo;A double-fettered Captive,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"note.isrc" href="#note.i" name="note.isrc">9</a> his solitude being
the one and his blindness the other. Like most of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e434" href="#xd21e434" name=
"xd21e434">15</a>]</span>scholars of his age, in the absence of regular
educational institutions, with perhaps one or two exceptions, he had to
devote a part of his time to the large number of pupils that flocked to
Ma&rsquo;arrah from all parts of Asia Minor, Arabia, and India. Aside
from this, he dictated to his numerous amanuenses on every possible and
known subject. He is not only a poet of the first rank, but an
essayist, a literary critic, and a mathematician as well. Everything he
wrote was transcribed by many of his admirers, as was the fashion then,
and thus circulated far and near. Nothing, however, was preserved but
his Diwans, his Letters and the Epistle of Forgiveness,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e436src" href="#xd21e436" name="xd21e436src">10</a>
of which I shall yet have occasion to speak.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e439src" href="#xd21e439" name="xd21e439src">11</a></p>
<p class="par">His reputation as poet and scholar had now, after his
return from Baghdad, overleaped the horizons, as one writer has it.
Honors were conferred upon him successively by the rulers and the
scholars of his age. His many noted admirers were in constant
communication with him. He was now looked upon as &ldquo;the master of
the learned, the chief of the wise, and the sole monarch of the bards
of his century.&rdquo; Ma&rsquo;arrah<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e446src" href="#xd21e446" name="xd21e446src">12</a> became the
Mecca of every literary aspirant; ambitious young scholars came there
for <span class="corr" id="xd21e449" title=
"Source: enlightment">enlightenment</span> and inspiration. And
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, although a pessimist, received them with his wonted
kindness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e452" href="#xd21e452" name=
"xd21e452">16</a>]</span>and courtesy. He imparted to them what he
knew, and told them candidly what he would not teach, since, unlike
other philosophers, he was not able to grasp the truth, nor compass the
smallest of the mysteries of creation. In his latter days, youthful
admirers sought his blessing, which he, as the childless father of all,
graciously conferred, but with no self-assumed spiritual or temporal
authority.</p>
<p class="par">For thirty years he remained a vegetarian, living the
life of an ascetic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e456src" href="#xd21e456"
name="xd21e456src">13</a> This mode of living led his enemies to accuse
him of renouncing Islam and embracing Brahminism, one of the tenets of
which forbids the slaughter of animals. The accusation was rather
sustained by the dispassionate attitude he held towards it, and,
furthermore, by his vehement denunciation of the barbarous practice of
killing animals for food or for sport.</p>
<p class="par">Most of the censors of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala were either
spurred to their task by bigotry or animated by jealousy and ignorance.
They held him up to ridicule and opprobrium, and such epithets as
heretic, atheist, renegade, etc., were freely applied. But he was
supremely indifferent to them all,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e462src"
href="#xd21e462" name="xd21e462src">14</a> and never would he cross
swords with any particular individual; he attacked the false doctrines
they were teaching, turning a deaf ear to the virulent vituperations
they hurled upon him. I fail to find in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e474" href="#xd21e474" name=
"xd21e474">17</a>]</span>three volumes of his poems, even in the
Letters, one acrimonious line savoring of personality.</p>
<p class="par">Ibn-Khillikan, The Plutarch of Arabia, who is cautious
and guarded in his statements, speaking of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, truly
says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His asceticism, his deep sense of right and
wrong, his powerful intellect, his prodigious memory, and his wide
range of learning, are alike acknowledged by both friend and
foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His pessimism was natural, in part hereditary. The man
was nothing if not genuine and sincere. Ruthlessly he said what he
thought and felt. He had no secrets to hide from the world, no thoughts
which he dared not express. His soul was as open as Nature; his mind
was the polished mirror of his age.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e482src"
href="#xd21e482" name="xd21e482src">15</a> It may be that had he not
been blind-stricken and had not small-pox disfigured his features, he
might have found a palliative in human society. His pessimism might not
have been cured, but it might have been rendered at least enticing.
Good-fellowship might have robbed it of its sting. Nor is his strong
aversion to marriage, in view of these facts, surprising.</p>
<p class="par">He lived to know that &ldquo;his fame spread from the
sequestered village of Ma&rsquo;arrah to the utmost confines of the
Arabic speaking world.&rdquo; In the spring of 1055 A.D. he died, and
was buried in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e487" href=
"#xd21e487" name="xd21e487">18</a>]</span>garden surrounding his home.
Adh-Dhahabi states that there were present at his grave eighty poets,
and that the Koran was read there two hundred times in a fortnight.
Eighty poets in the small town of Ma&rsquo;arrah sounds incredible. But
we must bear in mind that almost every one who studies the Arabic
grammar has also to study prosody and versification and thus become at
least a rhymster. Even to-day, the death of a noted person among the
Arabs, is always an occasion for the display of much eloquence and
tears, both in prose and verse.</p>
<p class="par">Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, beside being a poet and scholar of the
first rank, was also one of the foremost thinkers of his age. Very
little is said of his teachings, his characteristics, his many-sided
intellect, in the biographies I have read. The fact that he was a
liberal thinker, a trenchant writer,&mdash;free, candid, downright,
independent, skeptical withal,&mdash;answers for the neglect on the
part of Mohammedan doctors, who, when they do discuss him, try to
conceal from the world what his poems unquestionably reveal. I am
speaking, of course, of the neglect after his death. For during his
life-time he was much honored, as I have shown, and many distinguished
travellers came especially to Ma&rsquo;arrah to see him. He was also
often called upon to act as intercessor with the Emirs for the natives
of his village.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e491src" href="#xd21e491"
name="xd21e491src">16</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e494" href=
"#xd21e494" name="xd21e494">19</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The larger collection of his poems, the
Luzumiyat,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e497src" href="#xd21e497" name=
"xd21e497src">17</a> was published in Cairo, in two volumes, by Azeez
Zind, from an original Ms. written in the twelfth century, under
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s own title <i lang="ar-latn">Luzum ma la
Yalzam</i>, or the Necessity of what is Unnecessary. This title refers
to the special system of rhyming which the poet adopted. And the poems,
published in desultory fashion, were written, it seems, at different
periods of his life, and are arranged according to his particular
alphabetical system of rhyming. They bear no titles except, &ldquo;And
he also says, rhyming with so and so,&rdquo; whatever the consonant and
vowel may be. In his Preface to the Luzumiyat he says:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It happened that I composed these poems during
the past years, and in them I have always aimed at the truth. They are
certainly free from the blandishments of exaggeration. And while some
of them are written in glorification of God, who is above such glory,
others are, as it were, a reminder to those who forget, a pinch to
those who sleep, and a warning to the children of the earth against the
wiles of the great world, where human rights and human gratitude are
often strangled by the same hand of Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As for the translation of these chosen quatrains, let me
say at the outset that it is almost impossible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e507" href="#xd21e507" name=
"xd21e507">20</a>]</span>to adhere to the letter thereof and convey the
meaning without being insipid, dull, and at times even ridiculous.
There being no affinity between the Arabic and the English, their
standards of art and beauty widely differ, and in the process of
transformation the outer garment at times must necessarily be doffed. I
have always adhered to the spirit, however, preserving the native
imagery where it was not too clannish or grotesque. I have added
nothing that was foreign to the ruling idea, nor have I omitted
anything that was necessary to the completion of the general thought.
One might get an idea of what is called a scholarly translation from
the works of any of the Orientalists who have made a study of
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala. The first English scholar to mention the poet, as far
as I know, was J. D. Carlisle, who in his &ldquo;Specimens of Arabic
Poetry&rdquo;, published in 1810, has paraphrased in verse a quatrain
on Pride and Virtue. He also translated into Latin one of
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s bold epigrams, fearing, I suppose, to publish
it at that time in English.</p>
<p class="par">The quatrains which are here published are culled from
the three Volumes of his poems, and they are arranged, as nearly as may
be, in the logical order of their sequence of thought. They form a kind
of eclogue, which the poet-philosopher delivers from his prison in
Ma&rsquo;arrah. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e511" href=
"#xd21e511" name="xd21e511">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Once, in Damascus, I visited, with some friends, a
distinguished Sufi; and when the tea was being served, our host held
forth on the subject of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s creed. He quoted from
the Luzumiyat to show that the poet-philosopher of Ma&rsquo;arrah was a
true Sufi, and of the highest order. &ldquo;In his passionate hatred of
the vile world and all the vile material manifestations of life,&rdquo;
quoth our host, &ldquo;he was like a dervish dancing in sheer
bewilderment; a holy man, indeed, melting in tears before the distorted
image of Divinity. In his aloofness, as in the purity of his spirit,
the ecstatic negations of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala can only be translated in
terms of the Sufi&rsquo;s creed. In his raptures, <i lang=
"ar-latn">shathat</i>, he was as distant as Ibn ul-Arabi; and in his
bewilderment, <i lang="ar-latn">heirat</i>, he was as deeply
intoxicated as Ibn ul-Fared. If others have symbolized the Divinity in
wine, he symbolized it in Reason, which is the living oracle of the
Soul; he has, in a word, embraced Divinity under the cover of a
philosophy of extinction.&rdquo;...</p>
<p class="par">This, and more such from our Sufi host, to which the
guests gently nodded understanding. One of them, a young poet and
scholar, even added that most of the irreligious opinions that are
found in the Luzumiyat were forced upon the poet by the rigorous system
of rhyming he adopted. The Rhyme, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e523" href="#xd21e523" name="xd21e523">22</a>]</span>then, is
responsible for the heresies of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala! Allah be praised! But
this view of the matter was not new to me. I have heard it expressed by
zealous Muslem scholars, who see in Abu&rsquo;l-Ala an adversary too
strong to be allowed to enlist with the enemy. They will keep him, as
one of the &ldquo;Pillars of the Faith,&rdquo; at any cost. Coming from
them, therefore, this rhyme-begotten heresy theory is not
surprising.</p>
<p class="par">But I am surprised to find a European scholar like
Professor Margoliouth giving countenance to such views; even repeating,
to support his own argument,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e527src" href=
"#xd21e527" name="xd21e527src">18</a> such drivel. For if the system of
rhyme-ending imposes upon the poet his irreligious opinions, how can we
account for them in his prose writings? How, for instance, explain his
book &ldquo;<i lang="ar-latn">Al-fusul wal Ghayat</i><span class="corr"
id="xd21e532" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (The Chapters and
the Purposes), a work in which he parodied the Koran itself, and which
only needed, as he said, to bring it to the standard of the Book,
&ldquo;the polishing of four centuries of reading in the pulpit?&rdquo;
And how account for his &ldquo;<i lang="ar-latn">Risalat
ul-Ghufran</i>&rdquo; (Epistle of Forgiveness), a most remarkable work
both in form and conception?&mdash;a Divina Comedia in its cotyledonous
state, as it were, only that Abu&rsquo;l-Ala does not seem to have
relished the idea of visiting Juhannam. He must have felt that in his
&ldquo;three earthly prisons&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e538" href="#xd21e538" name="xd21e538">23</a>]</span>he had had
enough of it. So he visits the Jannat and there meets the pagan bards
of Arabia lulling themselves in eternal bliss under the eternal shades
of the <i lang="ar-latn">sidr</i> tree, writing and reading and
discussing poetry. Now, to people the Muslem&rsquo;s Paradise with
heathen poets who have been forgiven,&mdash;hence the title of the
Work,&mdash;and received among the blest,&mdash;is not this clear
enough, bold enough, loud enough even for the deaf and the blind?
&ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; says Professor Nicholson, speaking of The
Epistle of Forgiveness,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e544src" href=
"#xd21e544" name="xd21e544src">19</a> &ldquo;is carried out with such
ingenuity and in a spirit of audacious burlesque that reminds one of
Lucien.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This does not mean, however, that the work is
essentially of a burlesque quality. Abu&rsquo;l-Ala had humor; but his
earnest tone is never so little at an ebb as when he is in his happiest
mood. I quote from The Epistle of Forgiveness:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Sometimes you may find a man skilful in his
trade,&rdquo; says the Author, &ldquo;perfect in sagacity and in the
use of arguments, but when he comes to religion he is found obstinate,
so does he follow in the old groove. Piety is implanted in human
nature; it is deemed a sure refuge. To the growing child, that which
falls from his elders&rsquo; lips is a lesson that abides with him all
his life. Monks in their cloisters and devotees in their mosques accept
their creed just as a story is handed down from him who tells it,
without distinguishing between a true interpreter and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e552" href="#xd21e552" name=
"xd21e552">24</a>]</span>false. If one of these had found his kin among
the Magians, or among the Sabians, he would have become nearly or quite
like them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It does seem, too, that the strain of heterodoxy in
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala is partly hereditary. His father, who was also a poet
of some distinction, and his maternal uncle, were both noted for their
liberal opinions in religious matters. And he himself, alluding in one
of his poems to those who reproached him for not making the pilgrimage
to Mecca, says that neither his father, nor his cousin, nor his uncle
had pilgrimaged at all, and that he will not be denied forgiveness, if
they are forgiven. And if they are not, he had as lief share their
fate.</p>
<p class="par">But aside from his prose writings, in which, do what we
may, we can not explain away his supposed heresies, we find in the
Luzumiyat themselves his dominant ideas on religion, for instance,
being a superstition; wine, an unmitigated evil; virtue, its own
reward; the cremation of the dead, a virtue; the slaughter or even the
torture of animals a crime;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e559src" href=
"#xd21e559" name="xd21e559src">20</a> doubt, a way to truth; reason,
the only prophet and guide;&mdash;we find these ideas clothed in
various images and expressed in varied forms, but unmistakable in
whatever guise we find them. Here, for instance, is Professor
Nicholson&rsquo;s almost literal translation of a quatrain from the
Luzumiyat: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e562" href="#xd21e562"
name="xd21e562">25</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hanifs<a class="noteref" id="xd21e566src" href=
"#xd21e566" name="xd21e566src">21</a> are stumbling, Christians gone
astray,</p>
<p class="line">Jews wildered, Magians far on error&rsquo;s
way:&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">We mortals are composed of two great schools,</p>
<p class="line">Enlightened knaves or else religious fools.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And here is the same idea, done in a large
picture. The translation, literal too, is mine:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis strange that Kusrah and his people wash</p>
<p class="line xd21e202">Their faces in the staling of the kine;</p>
<p class="line">And that the Christians say, Almighty God</p>
<p class="line xd21e202">Was tortured, mocked, and crucified in
fine:</p>
<p class="line">And that the Jews should picture Him as one</p>
<p class="line xd21e202">Who loves the odor of a roasting chine;</p>
<p class="line">And stranger still that Muslems travel far</p>
<p class="line xd21e202">To kiss a black stone said to be
divine:&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Almighty God! will all the human race</p>
<p class="line xd21e202">Stray blindly from the Truth&rsquo;s most
sacred shrine?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e601src" href="#xd21e601"
name="xd21e601src">22</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The East still remains the battle-ground of the
creeds. And the Europeans, though they shook off <i>their</i> fetters
of moral and spiritual slavery, would keep us in ours to facilitate the
conquests of European commence. Thus the terrible Dragon, which is fed
by the foreign missionary and the native priest, by the theologians and
the ulama, and which still preys upon the heart and mind of Orient
nations, is as active to-day as it was ten centuries ago. Let those
consider this, who think Von Kremer exaggerated when he said,
&ldquo;Abu&rsquo;l-Ala is a poet many centuries ahead of his
time.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e608" href="#xd21e608"
name="xd21e608">26</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Before closing, I wish to call attention to a question
which, though unimportant in itself, is nevertheless worthy of the
consideration of all admirers of Arabic and Persian literature. I refer
to the similarity of thought which exists between Omar Khayyam and
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala. The former, I have reason to believe, was an imitator
or a disciple of the latter. The birth of the first poet and the death
of the second are not very far apart: they both occurred about the
middle of the eleventh century. The English reading public here and
abroad has already formed its opinion of Khayyam. Let it not,
therefore, be supposed that in making this claim I aim to shake or
undermine its great faith. My desire is to confirm, not to
weaken,&mdash;to expand, not contract,&mdash;the Oriental influence on
the Occidental mind.</p>
<p class="par">Whoever will take the trouble, however, to read Omar
Khayyam in conjunction with what is here translated of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala,
can not fail to see the striking similarity in thought and image of

are to a great extent imported from Ma&rsquo;arrah. But the Arab
philosopher in his religious opinions is far more outspoken than the
Persian tent-maker. I do not say that Omar was a plagiarist; but I say
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e616" href="#xd21e616" name=

most of his liberal and skeptical views from Hobbes, Locke and Bayle,
so did Omar acquire his from Abu&rsquo;l-Ala. In my notes to these
quatrains I have quoted in comparison from both the Fitzgerald and the
Herron-Allen versions of the Persian poet; and with so much or so
little said, I leave the matter in the hands of the reader, who, upon a
careful examination, will doubtless bear me out as to this point.

Kremer on Abu&rsquo;l-Ala. And I have seen copies of a certain German
Asiatic Review in which were published translations, made by that
eminent Orientalist, of many poems from the Luzumiyat. He speaks of
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala as one of the greatest moralists of all times, whose

Arabs,&rdquo; discusses the poet at length and renders into English
some poems from the Luzumiyat. A work was published by Charles

sitting on an old hair matting. He was very old, and the disease that
attacked him in his boyhood had left its deep traces on his emaciated
face. He bade me come near him and blessed me as he placed his hand on

of the poet, is unnecessarily captious at times. He would seem partial
to the suffrage of orthodox Mohammedans with regard to
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala&rsquo;s unorthodox religious views. But they have a
reason, these ulama, for endeavoring to keep a genius like
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala within the pale of belief. Which reason, let us hope,
has no claim on Prof. Margoliouth. And in his attempt to depreciate

the trodden path. I find, however, in his minor Diwan, <i>Suct

a slight manifestation of his youthful ardor, of which this and the

Saffat, I find this upon it: &ldquo;And is that a pure bounty, or the

the jasmine; and of one of the trees of Jericho, whose fruit is like

<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Luzumiyat&rdquo; of Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, as
rendered into English by Mr. Ameen Rihani, is more than a mere
translation&mdash;it is excellent poetry. Aside from its interest as a
literary curiosity, it possesses intrinsic value as literature of a
high quality. The historical matter contained in the preface of the
book, as well as the notes following the preface, will appeal to the
scholar who makes a study of the best expressions of Oriental
thought.&mdash;James B. Kenyon.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The first English rendition of the Luzumiyat of
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, comes from Ameen Rihani, the author of the Book of
Khaled, who has selected the quatrains from three volumes of the works
of the Syrian poet. For those who cling to a childish haze concerning
Assyrians and Syrians, we would add that while the Assyrian comes down
like a wolf on the fold, the Syrian, at least this particular one, has
a tread like Omar Khayyam. Therein lies the chief interest of the
Luzumiyat, unfair as it may be, in view of the fact that
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala died at about the time Omar was born. So marked and
far-reaching is the resemblance, that we might almost bring ourselves
to the belief that in Omar Khayyam was recreated the soul of
Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, with subtle changes, notable among them the casting
off of the tenets of prohibition, and a substitution of fatalism for
stoicism.&mdash;The Sun (New York). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">What Fitzgerald did for the Man of Neishapur in his
wonderful version of the Rubaiyat, Mr. Rihani has done, in scarcely
inferior measure, for his own remote ancestor Abu&rsquo;l-Ala. Mr.
Rihani, who is a poet and essayist in English as well as in Arabic, has
made a permanent addition to Literature. The Luzumiyat can not be
displaced.&mdash;Michael Monahan.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Mr. Rihani has rendered valuable service to Literature
in making the career of &ldquo;The Lucretius of Islam,&rdquo; as he
happily calls him, known to the general reader in the English-speaking
world.... The similarity of the Luzumiyat to Omar Khayyam under certain
aspects, should win for Rihani&rsquo;s brilliant rendering a generous
measure of recognition. As it is, the rare merits of the book, the
critical power of the preface, the skill and sincere feeling exhibited
in the verse, and the wide knowledge of English Literature shown in the
notes, make it, to my mind, a little masterpiece.&mdash;Percy
White.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The similarity in some parts of the Luzumiyat to Omar
Khayyam is striking. But Abu&rsquo;l-Ala, to my mind, is a greater
poet, and he is at times so remarkably modern. I am glad to make his
acquaintance through your excellent translation.&mdash;R. B.
Cunninghame Graham. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2581" href=

<p class="par">There is a compelling power in his attack on hypocrisy
and quackery, in his recognition of the supremacy of reason and the
human soul. Those who still fondly turn to the &ldquo;Rubaiyat&rdquo;
for enjoyment will surely find stimulus, too, and pleasure in these
ruthless rhymes.&mdash;Asia.</p>

public domain material from the Google Books project.)
This digital edition is dedicated to the people of Syria,
in the hope that the seeds of rationality will once again
find a fertile soil in your country.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
